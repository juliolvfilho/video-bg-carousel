# video-bg-carousel
An extremely simple image carousel with background video powered by Firebase.

It consists of an automatic image carousel (no click or key to change images) built in HTML that can be remotely configured in real time. Ideal for viewing bulletin boards in companies, advertising in commercial establishments, etc.

This project is just a rough draft so it is desirable that you make modifications to better suit your needs.

You can host it for free on Firebase. A live example can be found at https://video-bg-carousel.web.app
